# Goals of `shinymde`

`shinymde` provides an application (user interface) to ease the process of missing data exploration. The core functionality accessed is programmed in the code only package [mde](https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/mde). It is hoped that this will provide an even easier way to explore missing data.

# Installation

To install, please run the following in `R`. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Nelson-Gon/shinymde")
# provide branches for dev version  
devtools::install_github("Nelson-Gon/shinymde@dev")
```


# Running the App

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shinymde)
run_app()
```

# Test the app

`shinymde` is currently deployed at https://nelson-gon.shinyapps.io/shinymde/ where users can use the app via a browser. Please test the app there and let us know what you think. Thank you! 

# Currently Implemented features 

- [x] Summary of missingness

This uses [mde](https://nelson-gon.github.io/mde)'s `na_summary` function to 
generate a simple missingness report. The user can also download this report for 
use in other purposes. 

- [x] Recoding as NA and recoding NA as 

This allows a user to recode a given value as `NA`, R's handler of missing values
or convert `NA`s to some other value. It uses `mde`'s `recode_*` functions. 

- [x] Conditional recoding 

This allows one to recode values conditionally. This supports `recode_as_na_for`,
`recode_as_na_if`, and other conditional recoding functions. 

- [x] Drop based on missingness

This uses `mde`'s `drop_na_*` functions. 


- [x] Missingness plots

# Features that need further development (help)

If you would like to work on this project, here is a features list that could
be a good place to start.

- [x] Add user guides in the form of tooltips wherever possible. 
- [ ] Add unit tests. 

- [x] Add hovers to user input 

- [ ] Switchable dark mode 

- [x] Control `pattern_type`/`subset_cols` choice in `na_summary`.

- [ ] Use cached filename in input filename if a user quits the program. 

- [ ] Add user help pages that link to `mde` documentation on click or as an independent tab. 

- [x] Allow user to choose plot type.

- [x] Support dates in [mde](https://nelson-gon.github.io/mde)

- [x] Allow control over visible text on visual summaries.

Thank you and keep building,
